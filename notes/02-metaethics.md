##  the error theory

no moral statements are true.  moral statements are not the sort of things that are capable of being true or false.  sometimes people make moral statements that they think are true.  but no moral statements are true.

no true moral statements - 'abortion is wrong' and 'abortion is right' are both false

like atheism about morality - 'god is loving' and 'god is hateful' are false

##  non-cognitivism

no moral statements are true.  no moral statements are false.  moral statements are not the soft of things that are capable of being true or false.  they aren't real statements.  they just serve to express feelings, issue commands, and stuff like that.

just expressing emotions or issuing commands - 'abortion is wrong' = 'boo for abortion' or 'don't have an abortion', 'abortion is right' = 'yay for abortion' or 'have an abortion'

non-cognitivism holds that ethical or moral claims are not statements that can be true or false, because they do not describe facts about the world.  instead, moral claims express emotions, issue commands, or reflect attitudes.  under non-cognitivism, the terms "right" and "wrong" are not used to indicate or falsehood, but to express approval, disapproval, or a prescription for action.  
  
##  subjectivism

a moral statement is true for a person if and only if that person sincerely believe that statement is true.

if someone makes the statement 'abortion is right' and that person believes it, then abortion is right for that person

if someone makes the statement 'abortion is wrong' and that person believes it, then abortion is wrong for that person

'abortion is right' = 'abortion is right for me'

'abortion is wrong' = 'abortion is wrong for me'

in subjectivism, truth in moral statements is relative to the individual.  if someone believes that a particular action is morally right, then it is right for them.  conversely, if someone believes an action is morally wrong, then it is wrong for them.  subjectivism denies the existence of universal or objective moral truths that apply to everyone.  instead, what is morally right or wrong is determined by an individual belief.

## relativism 

a moral statement is true for a person if and only if that statement is part of teh moral code of that person's society.  morality is like the stands of law and etiquette.  

if according to the moral code of my society, abortion is wrong, the the statement 'abortion is wrong' is true for me

if according to the moral code of my society, it is good to give to the poor, then 'giving to the poor is good; is true for my culture

these statements are true no matter what one believes.  societal norms shape what is considered morally right or wrong within a society.  relativism emphasizes that truth or morality is relative to different frameworks - whether individual beliefs, cultural norms, or situational contents rather than being universally agreed upon or absolute.

##  objectivism

some moral statements are true and some moral statements are false.  whether or not a moral statement is true or false does not depend on what anybody thinks about it.  objectivism holds that there are objective moral truths that apply universally, independent of individual or cultural beliefs.  moral statements are classified as true or false based on their correspondence with these universal standards

'giving to the poor is good' is true and it doesn't matter what anybody thinks about it

it is possible for individuals and societies to be mistaken about the truth and falsity of
moral statements

moral statements are like statements about science or math or history are supposed to be. they are true. and whether they are true doesnâ€™t depend on what anyone thinks.

##  some arguments against subjectivism

###  the first argument from moral progress

**premise 1**  if subjectivism is true, then tom became morally perfect just by believing that whatever he does is good

**premise 2**  but tom didn't become morally perfect

**conclusion**  so subjectivism is false

premise 1 -  this states that under subjectivism, simply believing that one's actions are morally good would make them so.  the premise attempts to capture the essence of subjectivism that moral rightness is a matter of individual belief.

premise 2 -  this premise asserts that tom did not become morally perfect.  the argument assumes that moral progress is possible and that tom did not achieve moral perfection.  the premise is intended to show that subjectivism is false.

conclusion -  this follows logically from the premises in a modus tollens argument form

if $P$ then $Q$, not $Q$; therefore, not $P$

###  the second argument from moral progress

**premise 1**  moral progress is possible

**premise 2**  if premise 1, then subjectivism is false

**conclusion**  so subjectivism is false

###  argument against subjectivism form disagreement

**premise 1**  if subjectivism is true, then moral disagreement never happens

**premise 2**  but moral disagreement does happen

**conclusion**  **so, subjectivism is false

###  the argument from moral error

**premise 1**  sometimes an individual has mistaken beliefs about morality

**premise 2**  if premise 1 then subjectivism is false

**conclusion**  so subjectivism is false

##  some arguments against objectivism

###  the argument from tolerance

**premise 1**  if tolerance is valuable, the objectivism is false

**premise 2**  tolerance is valuable

**conclusion**  so objectivism is false

##  the argument from disagreement against objectivism

**premise 1**  if well informed, open-minded people intractably disagree about a wide range of claims made 
in an area of inquiry, then there is strong evidence that claims made about that area of inquiry are not objective true

**premise 2**  well informed, open-minded people intractable disagree about a wide range of claims made about morality

**conclusion** so there is string evidence that claims ade about ethics are not objectively true

###  the argument against objectivism from occam's razor

**premise 1**  if a hypothesis is not needed to explain any observations, then we are not justified in believing it

**premise 2**  the hypothesis that moral properties exist is not needed to explain any of our observations

**conclusion**  therefore, we are not justified in believing that moral properties exist

premise 1 is incorrect because there are hypothesis that exist that have no direct observations but are still believed to be true.  for example, the existence of dark matter, numbers, or what have you is a hypothesis that is not directly observed but is believed to be true based on the evidence that it explains.

###  the regress argument

**premise 1**  a moral belief is justified only if
    
i.  the moral belief is self evident or 
    
ii.  the moral belief is justified by some other belief

**premise 2**  there are no self-evident moral beliefs

**premise 3**  if a moral belief is justified by some other belief, then either

i.  that other belief is a moral belief or
    
ii.  that other belief is a non moral belief
    
**premise 4**  there are no moral beliefs that are justified by non moral beliefs

**premise 5**  there are no moral beliefs that are justified by non moral beliefs

**conclusion**  so there are no justified moral beliefs

self evident -  a belief about some statement is self evident if and only if any person that understands that statement is justified in believing it

'all bachelors are unmarried men'

'all triangles have three sides'
  
**the argument from non-universality**

**premise 1**  if objectivism is true, then there are universal moral laws

**premise 2**  but there are no universal moral laws

**conclusion**  so, objectivism is false

academic skepticism -  the view that we are not justified in believing that we know anything, knowledge is impossible

pyrrhonian skepticism -  is knowledge possible?  we don't know.  we are not justified in believing that we know anything
