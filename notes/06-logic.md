#  logic

###  introduction

an **argument** is a collection of statements, some of which are intended to provide support or evidence for one of the others.

a **statement** is something that can be true or false

###  sample arguments

**valid argument**, but **not factually correct**, and **not sound**

1.  all governors are rich
2.  bieber is a governor
3.  so, bieber is rich

**invalid argument**, but **is factually correct**, and **not sound**

1.  some governors are rich
2.  kelly is a governor
3.  so, kelly is rich

**valid argument**, **is factually correct**, and **is sound**

7.  all governors are rich
8.  kelly is a governor
9.  so, kelly is rich

###  validity

an argument is valid if and only if it has a form that would make it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false

-  to test whether an argument is valid
-  first, image that the premises are true even if they are not
-  then ask yourself without appealing to any other knowledge you have, whether you could still image the conclusion being false
-  if you can, the argument is not valid
-  if you cannot, then the argument is valid

validity has nothing to do with the actual truth or falsity of the premises.  a valid argument can have false premises.  if you preserve the structure of an argument, you can preserve its validity.

###  factual correctness

an argument is factually correct if and only if its premises are true.  and you can use your knowledge of the world to determine whether the premises are true.

###  soundness

an argument is sound if and only if it is valid and factually correct

###  operators and basic statements

to find the form of an argument, look for operators and basic statements.

operator takes other statements and turns them into a new statement

basic statement statement without any operators in it

some operators include if... then..., not...

##  modus ponens

1.  if scott sees, blue
2.  then the sky is blue
3.  so, the sky is blue

basic statements "scott sees blue", and "the sky is blue"

operator "if..., then..."

**valid argument for modus ponens**

1.  if P, then Q
2.  P
3.  So, Q

**invalid argument for modus ponens**

1.  if P, then Q
2.  Q
3.  So, P
