Pick a chapter from Beyond the Code - chapter 5 honesty and deception

The chapter honesty and deception entails the dynamics of honesty beyond simply telling the truth, delving deep into moral concepts such as deception, truth, honesty, lying, omissions, and self deception.

It starts by stating that truthfulness does not necessarily equate to honesty.  The truth is not necessarily literally for the information that is omitted is more powerful than the information that is included in presenting “all” of the facts as the truth.  

Additional questions regarding deception include asking questions regarding the nature of honesty in relation to truth.  Is honesty a matter of explicating every single piece of information regarding an event, person, place, or thing, etc.  There are instances where honesty is good and other instances where honesty (brutal honesty) is harmful. 

The chapter explores how deception can be as harmful as lying, there was an example made from PaymentsMD’s case, where truth was buried in legal jargon and consulted terms, misleading users into compromising their privacy.  Deception even in the absence of lying can be just as morally wrong.  Honesty also plays a really important role in someone’s trust and autonomy.  John Start Mill for example connects honesty to happiness, emphasizing its importance in relations and the world at large functioning.  Trust underpins interactions between people and their interactions, yet deception can be the opposing force and break trust.  Immanuel Kant connects honesty to autonomy, arguing that informed decision making requires transparency.  

The chapter then asks the question “what factors entail a beneficial act of honesty to be morally right”  and then “what factors make deception morally wrong”.  In the context of engineering honesty is important because it often involves information that is complex and needs to be altered in a way where a lay person can understand such information.
