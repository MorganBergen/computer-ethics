###  the principle of universal causation (puc)

every event has a cause

"e1 is the cause of e2" is roughly equivalent to "e1 is an event, e2 is an event, e1 occurs before e2, and e1 makes e2 occur."

###  the free will thesis (fwt)

sometimes people do things freely

"s performed action a freely" is roughly equivalent to "s performed action a, but s could have done otherwise; s could have avoided performing a"

"s is the source of s's action"

###  finger wiggling experiment

where we stand

after reflecting on the story about mysterious crop circles, everyone* is inclined to accept puc

after reflecting on the finger wiggling experiment, everyone* is inclined to accept fwt

*except for a few hardcore wiseguys

###  an argument for incompatibility of pub and fwt

1.  every event has a cause puc
2.  if every event has a cause, then determinism is true
3.  if determinism is true, then nobody every acts freely
4.  therefore, nobody every acts freely (denial of fwt)

determinism -  the facts about the past and the laws of nature entail every truth about the future

###  soft determinism

d1 -  e is a volition = df.  e is an act of willing, choosing, or intending to do some act

d2 -  e is a standard volition = df.  e is a volition, and e is caused by the beliefs and desires of the agent

d3 -  a is a voluntary action = df.  a is an action that is caused by a standard volition

###  a typical form of soft determinism

1.  every event has a cause puc
2.  there are some voluntary actions fwt
3.  people are morally responsible for their own voluntary actions, as well as for the consequences of those actions
4.  whenever a person performs a voluntary action, and is responsible for that action, he/she was caused to perform that action,a nd could not have done anything else instead

###  act diagram for soft determinism

bd -  bob wants money and believes that he can get it by robbing the convenience store

v -  bob wills, chooses, or intends to rob the store

a1 -  bob robs the convenience store

c1 -  mr. convenience is very unhappy

? $\rightarrow$ bd $\rightarrow$ v $\rightarrow$ a1 $\rightarrow$ c1

###  act diagram for poor paula's act

ufo1 -  aliens plant a chip in paula's brain

bd -  paula wants to kill great leader; thinks she call

v -  paula wills, chooses, or intends to kill great leader

a1 -  paula pulls the trigger

c1 -  the gun goes off

c2 -  the great leader is shot

c3 -  the great leader dies

ufo1 $\rightarrow$ bd $\rightarrow$ v $\rightarrow$ c1 $\rightarrow$ c2 $\rightarrow$ c3

###  an argument against soft determinism

**premise 1** -  if soft determinism is true, then poor paula is morally responsible for assassinating the great leader

**premise 2** -  it is not the case that poor paula is morally responsible for assassinating the great leader

**conclusion** -  therefore, it is not the case that soft determinism is true

###  the argument from logical fatalism

1.  I clap my hands at noon today
2.  necessarily, if I clap my hands at noon today, then it was true in 1000 ad that I would clap my hands at noon today
3.  if it was true in 1000 ad that I would clap my hands at noon today, then it was within my power to prevent its being true in 1000 ad that I would clap my hands at noon today
4.  therefore, it was never within my power to prevent its being true that I would clap my hands at noon today
5.  its being true in 1000 ad that I would clap my hands at noon today entails that I clap my hands at noon today.
6.  if 4 and 5 are true, then it was never within my power to avoid clapping my hands today
7.  if it was never within my power to avoid clapping my hands at noon today, then I did not clap my hands freely
8.  therefore, I did not clap my hands freely


###  the principle of alternative possibilities pap

pap -  an agent is morally responsible for performing a given act a only if he or she could have done otherwise.

###  the argument against pap

**premise 1** -  if pap is true, then jones is not morally responsible for voting for obama

**premise 2** -  but jones is morally responsible for voting for obama

**conclusion** -  so, pap is false
