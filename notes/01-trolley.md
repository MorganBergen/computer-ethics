# 1. trolley problem

the trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics. the general form of the problem is this: there is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. the trolley is headed straight for them. you are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. if you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. however, you notice that there is one person on the side track. you have two options:

1. do nothing and allow the trolley to kill the five people on the main track.

2. pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.

which is the more ethical option? or, more simply: what is the right thing to do?

most people would say that it is more ethical to pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person. this is because the principle of utilitarianism states that the right course of action is the one that maximizes overall happiness. in this case, pulling the lever would result in the death of one person instead of five, which would result in a greater overall happiness.

however, there are some who argue that pulling the lever is not the right thing to do. they believe that it is unethical to actively cause harm to someone, even if it results in a greater overall happiness. they argue that the right thing to do is to do nothing and allow the trolley to kill the five people on the main track.

there is the notion of actively causing harm and passively causing harm to consider.  actively causing harm is when you take an action that directly results in harm to someone.  passively causing harm is when you do nothing and allow harm to occur.  

actively causing harm is seen as more unethical than passively causing harm.  this is because actively causing harm involves making a conscious decision to harm someone, while passively causing harm involves allowing harm to occur without taking any action.  in the case of the trolley problem, pulling the lever is seen as actively causing harm, while doing nothing is seen as passively causing harm.  this is why some people argue that doing nothing is the more ethical option.  doing nothing is seen as less unethical than actively causing harm.  

#  2.  fat man trolley problem

a trolley is headed for five people who are tied to the tracks. you are standing on a bridge overlooking the tracks, and you see that the only way to save the five people is to push a very large man.  if you push a man you will stop the trolley and save the five people.  

i believe that it is unethical to push the large man, because of the action of intervention and actively causing harm.  it is more ethical to do nothing and allow the trolley to kill the five people.  this is because actively causing harm is seen as more unethical than passively causing harm.

#  3.  organ transplant trolley problem

a trolley is headed for five people who are tied to the tracks.  you are standing next to a lever, and you see that the only way to save the five people is to pull the lever.  if you pull the lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks where there is one person tied to the tracks.  the one person is a perfect match for five people who need organ transplants.  if you pull the lever, the trolley will kill the one person and the five people will get the organs they need to survive.

i believe that it is unethical to pull the lever, because of the action of intervention and actively causing harm.  it is more ethical to do nothing and allow the trolley to kill the five people.  this is because actively causing harm is seen as more unethical than passively causing harm.
