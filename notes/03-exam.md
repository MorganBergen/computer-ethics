## freewill

####  the principle of universal causation (puc)

puc:  every event has a cause

e1 is the cause of e2 

e1 is an event

e2 is an event

e1 occurs before e2

e1 makes e2 occur

####  the free will thesis (fwt)

fwt:  sometimes people do things freely

S performed action A freely

is roughly equivalent to 

S performed action A

but S could have done otherwise

S could have avoided performing A

S is the source of S's action

####  an argument for the incompatability of puc and fwt

1.  event event has a cause (puc)
2.  if every event has a cause, then determinism is true
3.  if determinism is true, then nobody every acts freely
4.  therefore, nobody ever acts freely (denial of fwt)

determinism: 


compatibilism, incompatabilism

soft determinism, an argument against soft determinism

pap, the agrument against pap

##  animal ethics

####  the argument from fred's basement and replies

1.  it is wrong for fred to torture the puppies in his basement
2.  if 1 is true, then it is wrong to eat factory farmed meat
3.  therefore, it is wrong to eat factory farmed meat

1st difference -  fred tortures the animals himself, most people eat meat that was tortured by others

2nd difference -  most people are unaware of the treatment of the animals they eat, so they are off the hook

3rd difference -  utilitarianism, if fred did not torture the puppies, they wouldn't suffer.  but if I stopped buying and eating factory farmed meat, no animals would be spared lives of misery.

1st reply -  image that cocamone production was a big business, it would still be wrong to ingest cocamone.

2nd reply - 


(a) and (h), argument for (a), argument against (h), revised argument against (h)
