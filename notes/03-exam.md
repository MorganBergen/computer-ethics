e1 is an event

e2 is an event

e1 occurs before e2

e1 makes e2 occur

####  the free will thesis (fwt)

S performed action A freely

is roughly equivalent to 

S performed action A

but S could have done otherwise

S could have avoided performing A

S is the source of S's action

####  an argument for the incompatability of puc and fwt

1.  event event has a cause (puc)
2.  if every event has a cause, then determinism is true
3.  if determinism is true, then nobody every acts freely
4.  therefore, nobody ever acts freely (denial of fwt)
