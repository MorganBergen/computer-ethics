####  trolley problem

the trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics. the general form of the problem is this: there is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. the trolley is headed straight for them. you are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. if you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. however, you notice that there is one person on the side track. you have two options:

option 1 - do nothing and allow the trolley to kill the five people on the main track.

option 2 - pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.

####  moral machine project

####  problems for moral machine project

####  error theory

no moral statements are true.  there is no such thing as good, bad, right, or wrong.

####  non-cognitivism

moral statements are neither true nor false, they are express expressions of emotions, attitudes, or prescriptions for actions.  

####  subjectivism

moral statements are true or false if and only if the person who believes in the moral statement is true or false

####  relativism

moral statements are true or false depending on the society or the culture.

####  objectivism

moral statements are true or false based on universal moral laws, and no not depend on the beliefs of humans or societies.

####  argument against subjectivism - the first argument from moral progress

premise 1 -  if subjectivism is true, then tom became morally perfect just by believing that his moral statement is true

premise 2 -  but tom never became morally perfect  

conclusion -  therefore, subjectivism is false

####  argument against subjectivism - the second argument from moral progress

premise 1 -  if moral progress is possible, then subjectivism is false  
premise 2 -  moral progress is possible  
conclusion -  therefore, subjectivism is false

####  argument against subjectivism -  from disagreement

premise 1 -  if subjectivism is true, moral disagreements never happen  
premise 2 -  moral disagreements happen  
conclusion -  therefore, subjectivism is false  

####  argument against objectivism - the argument from tolerance

premise 1 -  if tolerance is valuable then objectivism is false  
premise 2 -  tolerance is valuable  
conclusion -  therefore, objectivism is false  

####  argument again objectivism - the argument from disagreement

premise 1 -  if well informed open minded people intractably disagree about a wide range of claims made in an area of inquiry, then there is strong evidence that claims made about that area of inquiry are not objectively true  

premise 2 -  well informed open minded people intractably disagree about a wide range of claims made about morality =

conclusion -  there is strong evidence that claims made about ethics are not objectively true

####  argument against objectivism - the argument from occam's razor

premise 1 -  if a hypothesis is not needed to explain any of our observations, then we are not justified in believing it

premise 2 -  the hypothesis that moral properties exist is not needed to explain any of our observations

conclusion -  therefore, we are not justified in believing that moral properties exist
