#  kahane our cosmic insignificance

k says that scientists tells us 

the universe is more than 13 billion years old

the diameter of the part of the universe we are able to observe is at least 93 billion light years long

our own planet circles a star located two thirds of the way out of the center of the milky way galaxy which contains 100 - 400 billion stars

the observable universe contains 300 sextillion stars

on the whole the universe is almost entirely empty, an unending cold intergalactic night

we float in this immense cosmos "like a mote of dust in the morning sky" - carl sagan

we are "just a chemical scrum on a moderate size planet orbiting around a very average star in the outer suburb of one among a hundred billion galaxies" -  stephen hawking

##  intrinsic goodness and bassness vs insignificance 

##  the test for significance and insignificance

>  "for something to be important, it needs to possess, or bring about enough value to make a difference... if something is insignificant, then its not noteworthy, not important enough to care about."

for something to be significant it 

must have value

needs to make a real difference

needs to be important

needs to be something worthy of paying attention to

importance

stubbed toe -  think about all the people stubbing their toes right now.  they experience pain but it is bad.  and yet, we can't pay attention to all of their sufferings.  toe stubbing is so command that it is unimportant.  so it has negative value.  but it is unimportant.

math problem -  when a kid successfully solves a math problem, there is something good about it.  but so many kids have successfully solved so many math problems that it is insignificant.  and a few child geniuses have solved much more impressive math problems.  so a kid solving a math problem has value but it is insignificant.

seen alongside the horrific (or the wonderful), many things become simply insignificant - worthy of no attention at all  if you witness a terrible tragedy, it would be inappropriate to obsess about a stain on your suit.  after spending a week attending to soldiers injured and disfigured in the civil war, whitman write so his mother than "...really nothing we call trouble seems worth talking about."

value can't be changed by the presence or absence of other stuff.  but significance can.

significance can vary even as value stays fixed.

taken from a broad perspective, something that is valuable can have its significance decline to the point that it no longer matters.

even if nihilism is false, even if our lives have lots of value, we still might be utterly unimportant and make no difference at all.

##  cosmic significance

we can consider the significance of something by asking how much attention it _deserves all things considered._  

and we can consider significance at different scales - a dorm room $\rightarrow$ auburn's campus $\rightarrow$ alabama $\rightarrow$ united states $\rightarrow$ world $\rightarrow$ milky way galaxy

**cosmic significance** -  the attention something deserves when literally all things are considered

we can now explain why we feel insignificant in the face of a vast universe.  things tend to dramatically lose their significance as you zoom out and broaden the context.  what seems significant relative to just your room seems insignificant relative to all of auburn.  but there are lots of other great college towns like auburn.  and there are lots of other things in the world besides college towns...  when we zoom out to the final history of the world, how can we expect anything about humanity to matter?

we're just a mere dot in a vast universe.  how can anything human matter?

even the worst human tragedy seems to deserve no cosmic concern.

we're competing for attention with a vast totality.  how could this tiny speck deserve even a fraction of attention with all the stuff in the universe.

the bigger the picture we survey, the smaller the part of any point within it, and the less attention it can get... when we try to imagine a viewpoint encompassing the entire universe, humanity and its concerns seem to get completely swallowed up in the void.

##  are we really cosmically insignificant?

when we think about zooming out and taking the cosmic standpoint, we imagine looking at an image of space from a distant planet in which you can't see the earth at all

its true that if there is someone suffering in the andromeda galaxy right now, we don't pay much attention to it.  but that is because we don't know if someone is suffering there or not.  we are too far away to see what is going on.  and so someone looking at earth from such a distance wouldn't pay the suffering here much mind either.

k tells us not to confuse the cosmic standpoint with seeing things at a distance.  he tells us not to take the visual metaphor too literally.  when we adopt the cosmic standpoint

we don't become more ignorant and know less than we do now

##  why we might be of immense cosmic significance

because the universe is so vast and we are so small, it might take an observe a long time to find us.  but the observer might find nothing else of value.  we tend to forget how much empty space is in the universe and how much of little worth compared to us is out there.

compared to us, who cares about whether a black hole swallows a star  we are way more interesting and awesome than that.

the relevant question is -  are there other being like us?  are we alone?

##  if we are alone

then we are the only things that matter in the universe.  we are the only things that are cosmically significant

humans posses the most value in the cosmos and are the greatest part of total cosmic value.  what happens to use determines the value of the universe.  if we create hell on earth, then we make the universe itself bad.  if we become extinct, that might be the end of value in the universe.

if we are alone, then as pathetically small as we are, we are also of immense cosmic significance

if we are the only ones then, ironically, the cosmic standpoint ends up largely overlapping with our current terrestrial concerns, focused almost exclusively sentient and intelligent life on the surface of a tiny planet surrounding a humdrumstar in an otherwise unremarkably galaxy

on this picture we get cosmic significance from the combo of our having value plus our being surrounded by a bunch of other stuff with little or no value

our significance increases the more empty the universe is.  and the shorter amount of time that humans are here, the more significant we are.  if human life is just a brief blip in history surrounded by darkness on both sides, then we are all the more significant.

we could also posses significance if we are not alone but we stand out.  if every other planet in the universe is covered with grass and cows, we would still be of immense cosmic significance.

we would lose much of our uniqueness.

our significance would be diluted and the cosmic spotlight would no longer be on us.

our achievements, failures, and extinction wouldn't matter as much.

it would be even worse if our achievements pale in comparison to those of numerous far more advanced civilizations.

if god exists, then we are really, really cosmically insignificant.  we are still very valuable.  but our cosmic significance vanishes next to god.
